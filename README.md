# coding-prompts

## A Repo of coding prompts for you to level-up your skills

There are two ways to get the prompts:
1. You can clone the repo and run the `generate_project_structure.py` file. This will create a folder structure with a README.md file in each folder. The README.md file will contain the prompt for that project.
2. You can [download the latest built assets](https://github.com/geniuslounge/Code-Challenges/releases/latest) from the releases page. This will contain a `projects.zip` file with the folder structure and README.md files already created.


### Contributing to the project
1. Fork the repo
2. Create a branch
3. Use the `new_project.py` file to create a new project prompt.(it will automatically ammend the Table of contents file)
4. File a pull request and if approved / merged, your suggestion will appear in the list of challenges.
