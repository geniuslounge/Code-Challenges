# coding-prompts

### This is a repository of coding prompts. The prompts might appear on an interview somewhere, or they could just be examples that help you hone your skills.

### Feel free to put in a pull-request to add to the list.


If you'd like to contribute, please fork the repo, add a "project" entry to `TableOfContents.yml` (Project 000 is a template you can use). 
Once you're finished, open a pull request, and you should see it merged in shortly there after! (Don't worry about running the `Create Folders.py` script for your PR)



Cheers,
The Genius Lounge Team
